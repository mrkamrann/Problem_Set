Julie, a meticulous mathematician and avid problem solver, has been given a challenge involving a 3 positive integers.
She loves working with numbers and enjoys finding the most efficient solutions to complex problems. In this particular scenario, Julie is  given positive 
integers low, high, and divisor.

A number is beautiful if it meets both of the following conditions:

The count of even digits in the number is equal to the count of odd digits.
The number is divisible by divisor.
Return the number of beautiful integers in the range [low, high].

Create a C++ Function NumberOfBeautifulIntegers that will return an integer denoting the number of beautiful integers in the range [low, high].

Use appropriate Error Handling using the stdexcept library for the invalid test cases.


Input Type

An integer denoting low
An integer denoting high
An integer denoting divisor

Input Constraints

The value of low should be in the range [1, 10^9] inclusive.
The value of high should be in the range [1, 10^9] inclusive.
The value of low should be less than or equal to high.
The value of divisor should be in the range [1, 20] inclusive.
