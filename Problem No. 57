Jimmy was a young programmer, always eager to solve new challenges. One day, he came across a fascinating problem involving a vector of positive integers.

Jimmy was given nums, a vector of positive integers of size 2 * len. He had to perform len operations on this vector.

In the ith operation (1-indexed), Jimmy would:

Choose two elements, num_1 and num_2.
Receive a score of i * gcd(num_1, num_2).
Remove num1 and num2 from nums.
His goal was to return the maximum score he could receive after performing len operations.

The function gcd(num_1, num_2) is the greatest common divisor of num_1 and num_2.

Create a C++ Function MaxScore that will return an integer denoting the maximum score he could receive after performing len operations.

Use appropriate Error Handling using the stdexcept library for the invalid test cases


Input Type:

A vector<int> denoting nums.

Input Constraints:

The length of nums is 2 * len.
1 <= len <= 7.
Each element in nums should be between 1 and 10^6 inclusive.
