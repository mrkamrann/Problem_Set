John is given a 1-indexed vector of integers nums of length len.

He needs to distribute all elements of nums between two vectors vec1 and vec2 using len operations. Initially, he appends nums[1] to vec_1, nums[2] to vec_2, and for subsequent operations:

If GreaterCount(vec_1, nums[i]) > GreaterCount(vec_2, nums[i]), he appends nums[i] to vec_1.
If GreaterCount(vec_1, nums[i]) < GreaterCount(vec_2, nums[i]), he appends nums[i] to vec_2.
If counts are equal, he appends nums[i] to the vector with fewer elements (vec_1 if tie persists). If there is still a tie, he appends nums[i] to vec_1.
The vector result is formed by concatenating vec_1 and vec_2.

Help John create a C++ function __ that will return the integer vector result.

Input Types:

vector<int>> denoting the vector nums

Input Constraints:

1.The length of nums should be at least 3 and at most 10^5.
2.Each element in nums should be within the range from 1 to 10^9.
