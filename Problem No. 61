Jimmy was a young programmer, always eager to solve new challenges. One day, he encountered an intriguing problem involving the arrangement of students in a classroom.

Jimmy was given a rows x cols matrix called seats that represented the distribution of seats in a classroom. If a seat was broken, it was denoted by the '#' character;
otherwise, it was denoted by the '.' character.

Students could see the answers of those sitting next to them on the left, right, upper left, and upper right. However, they could not see the answers of the student 
sitting directly in front or behind them. Jimmy's task was to determine the maximum number of students that could take the exam together without any possibility of 
cheating.

Students had to be placed in seats in good condition.

Input Type:

A vector<vector<char>> denoting seats.

Input Constraints:

The matrix seats contains only characters '.' and '#'.
The number of rows (rows) is equal to seats.length.
The number of columns (cols) is equal to seats[i].length.
The values of rows and cols should be between 1 and 8 inclusive.
