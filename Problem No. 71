Julie is given an integer array receiver of length len and an integer counter. len players are playing a ball-passing game.

Julie chooses the starting player, start_index. The game proceeds as follows: player start_index passes the ball to player receiver[start_index], 
who then passes it to receiver[receiver[start_index]], and so on, for counter passes in total. The game's score is the sum of the indices of the players who 
touched the ball, including repetitions, i.e. start_index + receiver[start_index] + receiver[receiver[start_index]] + ... + receiver(counter)[start_index].
Return the maximum possible score.

Create a C++ Function GetMaxFunctionValue that will return an long long denoting the maximum possible score.

Notes:

receiver may contain duplicates.
receiver[start_index] may be equal to start_index.

Use appropriate Error Handling using the stdexcept library for the invalid test cases.

Input Type:

A vector<int> denoting receiver
An integer denoting start_index
An integer denoting counter

Input Constraints:

The length of receiver should be at least 1 and at most 10^5 inclusive.
Each value of receiver[i] should be in the range [0, len - 1] inclusive.
The values for counter should be in the range [1, 10^10] inclusive.
