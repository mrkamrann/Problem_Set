whether it's in coding puzzles or real-life scenarios

One day she is given a collection of strings represented by the vector words. She wants to find the smallest length of the string that contains each string in words
as a substring. 

You may assume that no string in words is a substring of another string in words.

Create a C++ Function ShortestSuperstring that will return an integer denoting the smallest string length containing each string in words as a substring.

Use appropriate Error Handling using the stdexcept library for invalid test cases.


Input Type:

A vector<string> denoting words.

Input Constraints:

The length of words should be in the range [1, 12] inclusive.
Each string words[i] should have a length in the range [1, 20] inclusive.
Each string words[i] should consist of lowercase English letters.
All strings in words are unique.
