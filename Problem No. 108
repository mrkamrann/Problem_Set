Julie lives in Bertown, where life has become difficult due to an excess of roads. The city has num_junctions junctions and num_roads two-way roads, 
allowing one to travel between any two junctions. The government spends a significant amount of resources maintaining these roads. To address this, the mayor
wants to close some roads so that only num_junctions - 1 roads remain, ensuring it's still possible to travel between any two junctions. Moreover, the mayor wants
exactly num_dead_ends dead ends, where a dead end is defined as a junction connected by only one road. Your task is to count the number of ways to close the roads
such that the following conditions are met:

There are exactly num_junctions - 1 roads left.

It is possible to travel between any two junctions.

There are exactly num_dead_ends dead ends in the resulting map.

Two ways are considered different if there is at least one road that is closed in the first way but open in the second.

Return the number of ways to close the roads under the given conditions.

Create a C++ function CountRoadClosures that will return an integer denoting the number of different ways of closing the roads. 

Use appropriate error handling using the stdexcept library for invalid test cases.

Input Type

An integer denoting num_junctions
An integer denoting num_dead_ends
A vector<pair<int,int>> denoting roads

Input Constraints

The values for num_junctions should be in the range [3, 10] inclusive.
The length of roads(num_roads) should be at least num_junctions - 1 and at most num_junctions * (num_junctions - 1) / 2 inclusive.
The values for num_dead_ends should be in the range [2, num_junctions - 1] inclusive.
Each value of roads[i][0] and roads[i][1] should be in the range [1, num_junctions] inclusive.
roads[i][0] should not be equal to roads[i][1]
