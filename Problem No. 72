Julie, a skilled mathematician and problem solver, was faced with an intriguing challenge one rainy afternoon. She received a vector nums containing exactly 2 * len 
integers.Julie's task was to split this vector into two smaller vectors of length len eachJulie needs to partition nums into two vectors of length len to minimize 
the absolute  difference of the sums of the vectors. To partition nums, Julie should put each element of nums into one of the two vectors.

Create a C++ Function MinimumDifference that will return an integer denoting the minimum possible absolute difference.

Use appropriate Error Handling using the stdexcept library for the invalid test cases.

Input Type:

A vector<int> denoting nums


Input Constraints:

The length of nums should be exactly 2 * len.
The values for len should be in the range [1, 15] inclusive.
Each value of nums[i] should be in the range [-10^7, 10^7] inclusive.
