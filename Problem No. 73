Julie is given a row_count x col_count matrix. Julie needs to return a new matrix answer where answer[row][col] is the rank of matrix[row][col].

The rank is an integer that represents how large an element is compared to other elements. It is calculated using the following rules:

The rank is an integer starting from 1.

If two elements p and q are in the same row or column, then:
If p < q then rank(p) < rank(q)
If p == q then rank(p) == rank(q)
If p > q then rank(p) > rank(q)

The rank should be as small as possible.

Create a C++ Function MatrixRankTransform that will return a vector<vector<int>> denoting  a new matrix answer where answer[row][col] is the rank of matrix[row][col].

Use appropriate Error Handling using the stdexcept library for the invalid test cases.

Input Type:

A vector<vector<int>> denoting matrix

Input Constraints:

The dimensions of matrix should be row_count x col_count where 1 <= row_count, col_count <= 500 inclusive.
Each value of matrix[row][col] should be in the range [-10^9, 10^9] inclusive.
