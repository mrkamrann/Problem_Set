Jimmy was a young programmer, always eager to solve new challenges. One day, he encountered an intriguing problem involving houses and mailboxes on a street.

Jimmy was given a vector houses where houses[i] is the location of the ith house along a street, and an integer counter, representing the number of mailboxes to 
be allocated on the street.

His task was to find the minimum total distance between each house and its nearest mailbox.

Jimmy knew that the test cases were designed so that the answer would fit in a 32-bit integer. He was ready to tackle this problem and find the optimal placement
of the mailboxes.

Create a C++ Function MinDistance that will return an integer denoting the minimum total distance between each house and its nearest mailbox.

Use appropriate Error Handling using the stdexcept library for the invalid test cases


Input Type:

A vector<int> denoting houses.
An integer denoting counter.


Input Constraints:

The value of counter should be between 1 and the length of houses inclusive.
The length of houses should be between 1 and 100 inclusive.
Each element in houses should be between 1 and 10^4 inclusive.
All the integers in houses are unique.
