John is given a string ring that represents the code engraved on the outer ring of a metal dial and another string key that represents the keyword that needs to be spelled, return the 
minimum number of steps to spell all the characters in the keyword.

Initially, the first character of the ring is aligned at the "12:00" direction. John should spell all the characters in key one by one by rotating ring clockwise or 
anticlockwise to make each character of the string key aligned at the "12:00" direction and then by pressing the center button.

At the stage of rotating the ring to spell the key character key[i]:

John can rotate the ring clockwise or anticlockwise by one place, which counts as one step. The final purpose of the rotation is to align one of ring's characters 
at the "12:00" direction, where this character must equal key[i].
If the character key[i] has been aligned at the "12:00" direction, press the center button to spell, which also counts as one step. After the pressing, John could 
begin to spell the next character in the key (next stage). Otherwise, you have finished all the spelling.

Create a C++ class Solution that will contain a function FindRotateSteps that will return an integer denoting the minimum number of steps to spell all the 
characters in the keyword.

Use appropriate Error Handling using the stdexcept library for the invalid test cases

Input Type:

A string denoting ring
A string denoting key

Input Constraints:

1.The length of ring and key is at least 1 and atmost 100.
2.ring and key consist of only lower case English letters.
3.It is guaranteed that key could always be spelled by rotating ring.
