Cena and Orton got employed as couriers. During the working day they are to deliver packages to len different points on the line. According to the company's
internal rules, the delivery of packages must be carried out strictly in a certain order. Initially, Cena is at the point with the coordinate source_1, 
Orton is at the point with the coordinate source_2, and the clients are at the points customers in the order of the required visit.

The guys agree in advance who of them will deliver the package to which of the customers, and then they act as follows. When the package for the i-th client is 
delivered, the one who delivers the package to the (i+1)-st client is sent to the path (it can be the same person who went to the point customers[i], or the other).
The friend who is not busy in delivering the current package, is standing still.

To communicate with each other, the guys have got walkie-talkies. The walkie-talkies work rather poorly at great distances, so Cena and Orton want 
to distribute the orders so that the maximum distance between them during the day is as low as possible. Help Cena and Orton to minimize the maximum distance 
between them, observing all delivery rules.

Create a C++ Function FindMinimumDistance that will return an integer denoting the minimum possible maximal distance between couriers during delivery. 

Use appropriate Error Handling using the stdexcept library for the invalid test cases.

Input Type:

An integer denoting source_1
An integer denoting source_2
A vector<int> denoting customers

Input Constraints:

The length of len should be at least 1 and at most 100,000 inclusive.
The value of source_1 should be in the range [0, 1,000,000,000] inclusive.
The value of source_2 should be in the range [0, 1,000,000,000] inclusive.
The values for customers should be in the range [0, 1,000,000,000] inclusive. There will be no two equal numbers among source_1, source_2, customers[0], ..., customers[len-1].
