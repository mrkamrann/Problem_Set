Julie is given a vector pairs, where pairs[i] = [x_i, y_i], and:

There are no duplicates.
x_i < y_i
​
 
Let ways be the number of rooted trees that satisfy the following conditions:

The tree consists of nodes whose values appeared in pairs.
A pair [x_i, y_i] exists in pairs if and only if x_i is an ancestor of y_i or y_i is an ancestor of x_i.
Note: The tree does not have to be a binary tree.

Two ways are considered to be different if there is at least one node that has different parents in both ways.

Return:

0 if ways == 0
1 if ways == 1
2 if ways > 1

A rooted tree is a tree that has a single root node, and all edges are oriented to be outgoing from the root.

An ancestor of a node is any node on the path from the root to that node (excluding the node itself). The root has no ancestors.

Create a C++ Function CheckWays that will return an integer denoting the number of rooted trees that satisfy the conditions

Use appropriate Error Handling using the stdexcept library for the invalid test cases.


Input Type:

A vector<vector<int>> denoting pairs


Input Constraints:

The length of pairs should be at least 1 and at most 10^5 inclusive.
Each pair should be a vector of size 2.
Each value of x_i should be in the range [1, 500] inclusive.
Each value of y_i should be in the range [1, 500] inclusive.
x_i < y_i
​The elements in pairs are unique.
