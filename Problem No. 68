Julie has created a game involving a cat named Tom and a mouse named Jerry. They play on a grid represented by a matrix of size rows x cols, where each 
element indicates a wall, floor, player (Tom or Jerry), or food. The grid is defined by the following characters:

Tom is represented by the character 'C'.
Jerry is represented by the character 'M'.
Floors, which can be walked on, are represented by the character '.'.
Walls, which cannot be walked on, are represented by the character '#'.
Food, which can be walked on, is represented by the character 'F'.
The grid contains exactly one 'C' for Tom, one 'M' for Jerry, and one 'F' for Food. The game is played as follows:

Tom and Jerry take turns to move, with Jerry moving first.
Each turn, Tom and Jerry can jump in one of four directions: left, right, up, or down.
They cannot jump over walls or move outside the grid.
Tom can jump up to cat_jump steps, and Jerry can jump up to mouse_jump steps. They can also choose to jump fewer steps or stay in the same position.
Jerry is allowed to jump over Tom.

If Tom and Jerry occupy the same position, Tom wins.
If Tom reaches the food first, Tom wins.
If Jerry reaches the food first, Jerry wins.
If Jerry cannot reach the food within 1000 turns, Tom wins.
Given the rows x cols matrix grid and the integers cat_jump and mouse_jump, determine if Jerry can win the game assuming both Tom and Jerry play optimally. Return true if Jerry can win, otherwise return false.

Create a C++ Function CanMouseWin that will return a boolean indicating whether Jerry can win the game if both Tom and Jerry play optimally.

Use appropriate Error Handling using the stdexcept library for invalid test cases.

Input Type:

A vector<vector<char>> denoting grid.
An integer cat_jump.
An integer mouse_jump.

Input Constraints:

The number of rows should be equal to grid.length.
The number of cols should be equal to grid[i].length.
The number of rows and cols should be in the range [1, 8] inclusive.
Each element grid[i][j] should be one of the characters 'C', 'M', 'F', '.', or '#'.
There should be exactly one 'C' for Tom, one 'M' for Jerry, and one 'F' for Food in the grid.
The integers cat_jump and mouse_jump should be in the range [1, 8] inclusive.
