Jimmy was a young programmer, always eager to solve new challenges. One day, he came across a fascinating problem while working on a grid-based puzzle.

Jimmy was given a binary matrix called grid of size len x len, where each cell was either a 0 or a 1. His task was to transform this grid to maximize the size of
an island. An island, he knew, was a group of 1s connected in any of the four cardinal directions: up, down, left, and right.

To make this happen, Jimmy was allowed to change at most one 0 in the grid to a 1. His goal was to find out the largest possible island size he could achieve 
with this single transformation.

With a twinkle in his eye, Jimmy sat down at his computer, ready to dive into the code and discover the optimal solution to this intriguing puzzle.

Help Jimmy create a C++ function LargestIsland that will return the size of the largest island in grid after applying this operation.

Use appropriate Error Handling using the stdexcept library for the invalid test cases

Input Type:

vector<vector<int>> denoting the 2D vector grid

Input Constraints:

1.The length of grid (denoted as len) should be at least 1 and at most 500 inclusive.
2.Each row grid[i] should have a length of len.
3.Each cell grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1.
