Since Jimmy's Summer vacation is starting, he has got a problem to solve as holiday homework.
Jimmy has been given a problem involving a vector nums and an integer diff. The task is to find a subarray of nums such that the absolute difference between diff and the bitwise OR of the subarray 
elements is minimized. Mathematically, find a subarray (contiguous non-empty sequence of elements) nums[left..right] such that the absolute difference between diff and the bitwise OR of the elements in 
the subarray (OR(nums[left]...nums[right])) is minimized. 
Create a C++ function ___ that will return this minimum possible absolute difference.


Input Type:

vector<int> denoting the vector nums

Input Constraints:

1.The length of nums should be at least 1 and at most 10^5.
2.Each element in nums should be within the range from 1 to 10^9.
3. The value of diff should be within the range from 1 to 10^9.
