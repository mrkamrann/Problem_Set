Jimmy was a young programmer, always eager to solve new challenges. One day, he came across a fascinating problem involving colorful balls.

Jimmy was given 2*len balls of count distinct colors. He was provided with a vector called balls of size count where balls[i] is the number of balls of color i.

All the balls would be shuffled uniformly at random, and then the first len balls would be distributed to the first box, and the remaining len balls to 
the second box.

Jimmy knew that the two boxes are considered different. For example, if there are two balls of colors color_a and color_b, and two boxes [] and (),
then the distribution [color_a] (color_b) is considered different from the distribution [color_b] (color_a).

His task was to find the probability that the two boxes have the same number of distinct balls. Answers within 10-5 of the actual value would be accepted as correct.


Create a C++ Function GetProbability that will return a double denoting the probability that the two boxes have the same number of distinct balls.

Use appropriate Error Handling using the stdexcept library for the invalid test cases


Input Type

A vector<int> denoting balls

Input Constraints:

1.The length of the vector balls (denoted as len) should be between 1 and 8 inclusive.
2.Each balls[i] should be between 1 and 6 inclusive.
3.The sum of the elements in balls is even.
