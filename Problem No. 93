Julie is faced with yet another problem on regular bracket sequences.

A bracket sequence is called regular if, by inserting "+" and "1" into it, Julie gets a correct mathematical expression. For example, sequences "(())()", "()", and "(()(()))" are regular, 
while ")(", "(()", and "(()))(" are not. Julie has a sequence of a bracket sequence that consists of characters "(", ")", and "?". Julie has to replace each character "?" with a bracket so that
she gets a regular bracket sequence. She has also given a 2D vector costs denoting where costs[i][0] and costs[i][1] is the cost of replacing the ith '?' with an opening or closing bracket.

For each character "?", the cost of its replacement with "(" and ")" is given. Among all the possible variants, Julie should choose the cheapest.

Create a C++ Function LeastCostSequence that will return an integer denoting the minimum cost.

Use appropriate Error Handling using the stdexcept library for invalid test cases.

Input Type:

A string denoting the sequence
A vector<vector<long long>> denoting costs

Input Constraints:

The length of the sequence should be at least 2 and at most 50,000 inclusive.
The sequence's length should be even.
The sequence consists of the characters '(', ')' and '?'.
Each value of costs[i][0] and costs[i][1] should be in the range [1, 1,000,000] inclusive.
The number of costs should be equal to the number of '?' in the sequence.
