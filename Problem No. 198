Jessica and her friend James are playing a game on a circular board with num cells. The cells are numbered from 1 to num_cells such that each 
cell i (1 ≤ i ≤ num_cells-1) is adjacent to cell i+1 and cell 1 is adjacent to cell num. Initially, each cell is empty.

Jessica and James take turns placing either an A or a B on the board, with Akmar going first. The letter must be placed on an empty cell. 
In addition, the letter cannot be placed adjacent to a cell containing the same letter.

A player loses when it is their turn and there are no more valid moves.

Output the number of possible distinct games where both players play optimally modulo 10^9 + 7. Note that we only consider games where some player has lost 
and there are no more valid moves.

Two games are considered distinct if the number of turns is different or for some turn, the letter or cell number that the letter is placed on were different.

A move is considered optimal if the move maximizes the player's chance of winning, assuming the other player plays optimally as well. More formally, if the 
player who has to move has a winning strategy, they have to make a move after which they will still have a winning strategy. If they do not, they can make any move.

Create a C++ function CountDistinctGames that will return an integer denoting the number of possible distinct games where both players play optimally 
modulo 10^9 + 7.

Use appropriate error handling using the stdexcept library for invalid test cases.

Input Type

An integer num denoting the number of cells on the board

Input Constraints

The value of num should be in the range [2, 10^6] inclusive.
