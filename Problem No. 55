Jimmy was a young programmer, always eager to solve new challenges. One day, he came across a fascinating problem involving navigating through a matrix.

Jimmy was given a grid with rows x cols, each cell containing an integer. He could move from any cell to an adjacent cell in all four directions. His goal was to 
find all strictly increasing paths in the grid,where a path is considered increasing if every subsequent cell in the path has a higher value than the previous one.
where he could move from a cell to any adjacent cell in all 4 directions.

His task was to return the number of strictly increasing paths in the grid such that he could start from any cell and end at any cell. Since the answer 
could be very large, he needed to return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

Two paths were considered different if they did not have exactly the same sequence of visited cells.

Create a C++ Function CountPaths that will return an integer denoting the number of strictly increasing paths in the grid such that he could start 
from any cell and end at any cell

Use appropriate Error Handling using the stdexcept library for the invalid test cases

Input Type:

A vector<vector<int>> denoting grid

Input Constraints:

The number of rows (denoted as rows) is equal to grid.length.
The number of columns (denoted as cols) is equal to grid[i].length.
The values of rows and cols should be between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
The product of rows and cols should be between 1 and 10^5 inclusive.
Each grid[i][j] should be between 1 and 10^5 inclusive.
