/*
Jimmy faced a challenging task with an integer vector nums. He needed to determine if he could sort nums in non-decreasing order using a special swapping operation. This operation allowed him to swap elements 
nums[i] and nums[j] if gcd(nums[i], nums[j]) > 1, where gcd(nums[i], nums[j]) denotes the greatest common divisor of nums[i] and nums[j].

Jimmy pondered over whether he could achieve the sorted order through these swaps. It was a puzzle that required careful consideration of the vector's elements and 
their relationships through their greatest common divisors.

Create a C++ Function GcdSort that will return true if it is possible to sort nums in non-decreasing order using the above swap method, or false otherwise. 

Use appropriate Error Handling using the stdexcept library for the invalid test cases


Input Type

vector<int> denoting nums

Input Constraints:

1.The length of nums  should be at least 1 and at most 30000 inclusive.
2.Each element nums[i] should be in the range [2, 10^5] inclusive.
