Jimmy was a young programmer, always eager to solve new challenges. One day, he came across a fascinating problem involving a directed graph with colored nodes.

Jimmy was given a directed graph of node_count colored nodes and edge_count edges. The nodes were numbered from 0 to node_count - 1.

He was given a string colors where colors[i] was a lowercase English letter representing the color of the ith node in this graph (0-indexed). He was also given a vector<vector<int>> edges where 
edges[j] = [a_j, b_j] indicated that there was a directed edge from node a_j to node b_j.

A valid path in the graph was a sequence of nodes x_1 -> x_2 -> x_3 -> ... -> x_k such that there was a directed edge from xi to x_i+1 for every 1 <= i < k. The color value of the path was the number of nodes 
that were colored the most frequently occurring color along that path.

Jimmy's task was to return the largest color value of any valid path in the given graph, or -1 if the graph contained a cycle.

Create a C++ Function LargestPathValue that will return an integer denoting the largest color value of any valid path in the given graph. 

Use appropriate Error Handling using the stdexcept library for the invalid test cases




Input Type:

A string denoting colors.
A vector<vector<int>> denoting edges.

Input Constraints:
