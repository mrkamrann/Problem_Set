Julie is given an undirected weighted graph with len vertices labeled from 0 to len - 1.

You are given the integer len and a vector edges, where edges[i] = [u_i, v_i, w_i] indicates that there is an edge between vertices u_i and v_i with a weight of w_i.

A walk on a graph is a sequence of vertices and edges. The walk starts and ends with a vertex, and each edge connects the vertex that comes before it and 
the vertex that comes after it. It's important to note that a walk may visit the same edge or vertex more than once.

The cost of a walk starting at node u and ending at node v is defined as the bitwise AND of the weights of the edges traversed during the walk. In other words, 
if the sequence of edge weights encountered during the walk is w0, w1, w2, ..., wk, then the cost is calculated as w0 & w1 & w2 & ... & wk, where & denotes the
bitwise AND operator.

You are also given a 2D vector query, where query[i] = [s_i, t_i]. For each query, you need to find the minimum cost of the walk starting at vertex s_i and 
ending at vertex t_i. If there exists no such walk, the answer is -1.

Return the vector answer, where answer[i] denotes the minimum cost of a walk for query i.

Create a C++ class Solution that will contain a function MinimumCost that will return a vector<int> denoting the vector answer.

Use appropriate Error Handling using the stdexcept library for the invalid test cases.

Input Type:

An integer denoting len
A vector<vector<int>> denoting edges
A vector<vector<int>> denoting query

Input Constraints:

The length of len should be at least 2 and at most 10^5 inclusive.
The length of edges should be at least 0 and at most 10^5 inclusive.
Each edge should be a vector of size 3.
Each value of u_i should be in the range [0, len - 1] inclusive.
Each value of v_i should be in the range [0, len - 1] inclusive.
u_i should not be equal to v_i
Each value of w_i should be in the range [0, 10^5] inclusive.
The length of query should be at least 1 and at most 10^5 inclusive.
Each query should be a vector of size 2.
Each value of s_i and t_i should be in the range [0, len - 1] inclusive.
s_i should not be equal to t_i
